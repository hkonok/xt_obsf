Please Check this file before loading xt_OBSF

Please remember:
1. Although the module apparently does not crash, it may crash while unloading, so give the server time to stop all
   communications and then unload the module. And the remote rebooting option must be available.

2. If the module is loaded on VM, the code should work as presented. But if it is on a REAL MACHINE, please comment out
   udp4_hwcsum() functions in xt_OBSF.c. Comment out the lines in which udp4_hwcsum() is called.

Requirements:
1. iptables version minimum 1.4.12
2. Package iptables-dev(el)
3. In CentOS, the kernel version is older and iptables latest version must be installed manually along with iptables-devel.
   Preferably, Ubuntu server can be used, there these things are of satisfactorily upgrade version.
